Run this app by doing py wordlehints.py

Go to the Wordle game on the web.
In the Python app you will see that its recommended first guess is crane.
A computer analysis was done (not by me) that determined that the optimum first quess for Wordle is the word crane.
Enter this guess into the Wordle game on the web. The Wordle game will give you its results by coloring each letter as
gray, beige or green.
In the Wordle app color the letter squares using the gray, biege and green buttons to match the Wordle game.
When all of the squares in a row have been filled in with colors, the next guess will be displayed. Enter this
guess into the Wordle game.
Again use the gray, biege and green buttons on the newest guess to duplicate the results from the Wordle game.
Continue this process until the Wordle game is completed.

For any guess, if you are not satisfied with the generated guess, you can change it using the abc button and 
clicking the square you want to change.

How does it work: The app uses a 12000 word dictionary of five letter words to find words that are compatible with
the results of the prior guesses. It selects from the eligible words based on the frequency with which different letters
are used in five letter words.
